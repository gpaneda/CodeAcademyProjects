          <h2>Bearded Dragon</h2>
          <p class="description">Pogona is a genus of reptiles containing eight lizard species (according to some sources, but some others say nine) 
          which are often known by the common name bearded dragons. The name "bearded dragon" refers to the "beard" of the dragon, 
          the underside of the throat which can turn black if they are stressed or see a potential rival. 
          They are adept climbers, spending significant amounts of time on branches and in bushes and near human habitation. 
          Pogona species bask on rocks and exposed branches in the mornings and afternoons. They are found throughout much of 
          Australia in a wide range of habitats such as deserts, shrublands and Eucalyptus woodlands</p>

          <h2>Blue Crayfish</h2>
          <p class="description">The blue crayfish (scientific name Procambarus alleni, sometimes called the electric blue crayfish, 
          the sapphire crayfish, or the Florida crayfish) is a species of freshwater crayfish endemic to Florida in the United States. 
          Its natural range is the area east of St. Johns River and all of Florida from Levy County and Marion County southwards, 
          as well as on some of the Florida Keys.[2] It is included on the IUCN Red List as a species of Least Concern. 
          The blue crayfish is frequently kept in freshwater aquaria.[3] In the wild, this species varies from brown-tan to blue, 
          but the aquarium strain has been selective bred to achieve a brilliant cobalt blue color.</p>

          <h2>Fennec Fox</h2>
          <p class="description">The fennec fox or fennec (Vulpes zerda) is a small crepuscular fox found in the Sahara of North Africa, 
          the Sinai Peninsula, South West Israel (Arava desert)[2] and the Arabian desert. It's most distinctive feature is its unusually large ears, which also serve to dissipate heat. 
          It's name comes from the Berber word (fanak), which means fox, and the species name zerda comes from the Greek word xeros 
          which means dry, referring to the fox's habitat.[3] The fennec is the smallest species of canid. 
          It's coat, ears, and kidney functions have adapted to high-temperature, low-water, desert environments. 
          Also, its hearing is sensitive enough to hear prey moving underground. 
          It mainly eats insects, small mammals, and birds.</p>

          <h2>Serval</h2>
          <p class="description">The serval (Leptailurus serval) is a wild cat native to Africa.
           It is rare in North Africa and the Sahel, but widespread in sub-Saharan countries except rainforest regions.
          It is the sole member of the genus Leptailurus and was first described by German naturalist 
          Johann von Schreber in 1776. Three subspecies are recognised. The serval is a slender, medium-sized cat that 
          stands 54–62 cm (21–24 in) at the shoulder and weighs 9–18 kg (20–40 lb). It is characterised by a small head, large ears, 
          a golden-yellow to buff coat spotted and striped with black, and a short, black-tipped tail. The serval has the 
          longest legs of any cat relative to its body size. </p>

          <h2>Bow Eel</h2>
          <p class="description">The ribbon eel (Rhinomuraena quaesita), also known as the leaf-nosed moray eel or bernis eel, 
          is a species of moray eel, the only member of the genus Rhinomuraena. What is now known as R. quaesita also includes the former 
          R. amboinensis. R. quaesita was used for blue ribbon eels and R. amboinensis for black ribbon eels, but these are now recognized 
          as the same species. The ribbon eel is found in lagoons and reefs in the Indo-Pacific ocean, 
          ranging from East Africa to southern Japan, Australia and French Polynesia. Although generally placed in the moray eel family Muraenidae, 
          it has several distinctive features leading some to place it in its own family, Rhinomuraenidae.</p>
