          <p class="description"><span style="font-weight:bold;">Pogona</span> is a genus of reptiles containing eight lizard species (according to some sources, but some others say nine) 
          which are often known by the common name bearded dragons. The name "bearded dragon" refers to the "beard" of the dragon, 
          the underside of the throat which can turn black if they are stressed or see a potential rival. 
          They are adept climbers, spending significant amounts of time on branches and in bushes and near human habitation. 
          Pogona species bask on rocks and exposed branches in the mornings and afternoons. They are found throughout much of 
          Australia in a wide range of habitats such as deserts, shrublands and Eucalyptus woodlands</p>

          <p class="description">The blue crayfish <span style="font-weight:bold;">(Procambarus alleni)</span>, sometimes called the electric blue crayfish, 
          the sapphire crayfish, or the Florida crayfish) is a species of freshwater crayfish endemic to Florida in the United States. 
          Its natural range is the area east of St. Johns River and all of Florida from Levy County and Marion County southwards, 
          as well as on some of the Florida Keys.[2] It is included on the IUCN Red List as a species of Least Concern. 
          The blue crayfish is frequently kept in freshwater aquaria.[3] In the wild, this species varies from brown-tan to blue, 
          but the aquarium strain has been selective bred to achieve a brilliant cobalt blue color.</p>

          <h2><a href="https://www.racinezoo.org/common-wallaroo-fact-sheet">Wallaroo</a></h2>
          <p class="description">Wallaroo is any of three closely related species of moderately large macropod, 
          intermediate in size between the kangaroos and the wallabies. 
          The word "wallaroo" is from Dharug walaru. In general, a large, slim-bodied macropod of the open 
          plains is called a "kangaroo"; a small to medium-sized one, particularly if it is relatively thick-set, is a 
          "wallaby": most wallaroos are only a little smaller than a kangaroo, fairly thickset, and are found in open country. 
          All share a particular habit of stance: wrists raised, elbows tucked close into the body, and shoulders thrown back, 
          and all have a large, black-skinned rhinarium.</p>

          <p class="description">The fennec fox or fennec <span style="font-weight:bold;">(Vulpes zerda)</span> is a small crepuscular fox found in the Sahara of North Africa, 
          the Sinai Peninsula, South West Israel (Arava desert)[2] and the Arabian desert. It's most distinctive feature is its unusually large ears, which also serve to dissipate heat. 
          It's name comes from the Berber word (fanak), which means fox, and the species name zerda comes from the Greek word xeros 
          which means dry, referring to the fox's habitat.[3] The fennec is the smallest species of canid. 
          It's coat, ears, and kidney functions have adapted to high-temperature, low-water, desert environments. 
          Also, its hearing is sensitive enough to hear prey moving underground. 
          It mainly eats insects, small mammals, and birds.</p>

          <p class="description">The serval <span style="font-weight:bold;">(Leptailurus serval)</span> is a wild cat native to Africa.
           It is rare in North Africa and the Sahel, but widespread in sub-Saharan countries except rainforest regions.
          It is the sole member of the genus Leptailurus and was first described by German naturalist 
          Johann von Schreber in 1776. Three subspecies are recognised. The serval is a slender, medium-sized cat that 
          stands 54–62 cm (21–24 in) at the shoulder and weighs 9–18 kg (20–40 lb). It is characterised by a small head, large ears, 
          a golden-yellow to buff coat spotted and striped with black, and a short, black-tipped tail. The serval has the 
          longest legs of any cat relative to its body size. </p>

          <p class="description"><span style="font-weight:bold;">Brachypelma hamorii</span> is a species of tarantula found in Mexico. It has been confused with Brachypelma smithi; 
          both have been called Mexican redknee tarantulas. Many earlier sources referring to B. smithi either do not distinguish between the 
          two species or relate to B. hamorii. B. hamorii is a terrestrial tarantula native to the western faces of the Sierra Madre Occidental 
          and Sierra Madre del Sur mountain ranges in the Mexican states of Colima, Jalisco and Michoacán. The species is a large spider, 
          adult females having a total body length over 50 mm (2 in) and males having legs up to 75 mm (3 in) long. Mexican redknee tarantulas are a 
          popular choice for enthusiasts. Like most tarantulas, it has a long lifespan.</p>

          <p class="description">The ribbon eel <span style="font-weight:bold;">(Rhinomuraena quaesita)</span>, also known as the leaf-nosed moray eel or bernis eel, 
          is a species of moray eel, the only member of the genus Rhinomuraena. What is now known as R. quaesita also includes the former 
          R. amboinensis. R. quaesita was used for blue ribbon eels and R. amboinensis for black ribbon eels, but these are now recognized 
          as the same species. The ribbon eel is found in lagoons and reefs in the Indo-Pacific ocean, 
          ranging from East Africa to southern Japan, Australia and French Polynesia. Although generally placed in the moray eel family Muraenidae, 
          it has several distinctive features leading some to place it in its own family, Rhinomuraenidae.</p>

          <p class="description">The red panda <span style="font-weight:bold;">(Ailurus fulgens)</span> is a mammal native to the eastern Himalayas and southwestern China. 
          It is listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List because the wild population is estimated at fewer than 10,000 mature individuals
           and continues to decline due to habitat loss and fragmentation, poaching, and inbreeding depression. The red panda has reddish-brown fur, a long, 
           shaggy tail, and a waddling gait due to its shorter front legs; it is roughly the size of a domestic cat, though with a 
           longer body and somewhat heavier. It is arboreal, feeds mainly on bamboo, but also eats eggs, birds, and insects. 
           It is a solitary animal, mainly active from dusk to dawn, and is largely sedentary during the day.</p>

          <p class="description">The strawberry poison frog or strawberry poison-dart frog<span style="font-weight:bold;"> (Oophaga pumilio)</span> 
          is a species of small poison dart frog found in Central America.[2] It is common throughout its range, 
          which extends from eastern central Nicaragua through Costa Rica and northwestern Panama. 
          The species is often found in humid lowlands and premontane forest, but large populations are also found in disturbed areas such as 
          plantations.[3] The strawberry poison frog is perhaps most famous for its widespread variation in coloration, comprising approximately 
          15–30 color morphs, most of which are presumed to be true-breeding. O. pumilio, while not the most poisonous of the dendrobatids, is the most 
          toxic member of its genus.</p>

          <p class="description">Box jellyfish <span style="font-weight:bold;">(class Cubozoa)</span> are cnidarian invertebrates distinguished by their cube-shaped medusae. 
          Some species of box jellyfish produce extremely potent venom: Chironex fleckeri, 
          Carukia barnesi and Malo kingi. Stings from these and a few other species in the class are extremely painful and can be fatal to humans.</p>

          <p class="description">The inland taipan <span style="font-weight:bold;">(Oxyuranus microlepidotus)</span>.
          (Oxyuranus) genus, and is endemic to semi-arid regions of central east Australia. 
         The inland taipan is the most venomous snake in the world. Based on the median lethal dose value in mice, its venom, drop for drop, is by far the most toxic of any snake – much more so than even sea snakes
         and it has the most toxic venom of any reptile when tested on human heart cell culture. Unlike most snakes, the inland taipan is a specialist mammal hunter so its venom is specially 
         adapted to kill warm-blooded species.It is estimated that one bite possesses enough lethality to kill at least 100 fully grown men, and, depending on the nature of the bite, 
         it has the potential to kill someone in as little as 30 to 45 minutes if left untreated. It is an extremely fast and agile snake that can strike instantly with extreme accuracy, 
         often striking multiple times in the same attack, and it envenoms in almost every case.</p>

          <p class="description">The cat or domestic cat <span style="font-weight:bold;">(Felis catus)</span> is a small carnivorous mammal.It is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae.[4] 
          Cats are similar in anatomy to the other felid species, with a strong flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp teeth and retractable claws 
          adapted to killing small prey. They are predators who are most active at dawn and dusk. Cats can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by mice and other 
          small animals. Compared to humans, they see better in the dark (they see in near total darkness) and have a better sense of smell, but poorer color vision. Cat communication includes the use of vocalizations including mewing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling and grunting as well as cat-specific body language. Cats also communicate by 
          secreting and perceiving pheromones. <span style="font-weight:bold;">This particularly cat is lazy and bullies the other cats in the household.</span></p>
