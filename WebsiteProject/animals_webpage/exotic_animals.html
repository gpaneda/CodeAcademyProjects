          <h2><a href="https://a-z-animals.com/animals/bearded-dragon/">Bearded Dragon</a></h2>
          <p class="description">Pogona is a genus of reptiles containing eight lizard species (according to some sources, but some others say nine) 
          which are often known by the common name bearded dragons. The name "bearded dragon" refers to the "beard" of the dragon, 
          the underside of the throat which can turn black if they are stressed or see a potential rival. 
          They are adept climbers, spending significant amounts of time on branches and in bushes and near human habitation. 
          Pogona species bask on rocks and exposed branches in the mornings and afternoons. They are found throughout much of 
          Australia in a wide range of habitats such as deserts, shrublands and Eucalyptus woodlands</p>

          <h2>Blue Crayfish</h2>
          <p class="description">The blue crayfish (scientific name Procambarus alleni, sometimes called the electric blue crayfish, 
          the sapphire crayfish, or the Florida crayfish) is a species of freshwater crayfish endemic to Florida in the United States. 
          Its natural range is the area east of St. Johns River and all of Florida from Levy County and Marion County southwards, 
          as well as on some of the Florida Keys.[2] It is included on the IUCN Red List as a species of Least Concern. 
          The blue crayfish is frequently kept in freshwater aquaria.[3] In the wild, this species varies from brown-tan to blue, 
          but the aquarium strain has been selective bred to achieve a brilliant cobalt blue color.</p>

          <h2>Wallaroo</h2>
          <p class="description">Wallaroo is any of three closely related species of moderately large macropod, 
          intermediate in size between the kangaroos and the wallabies. 
          The word "wallaroo" is from Dharug walaru. In general, a large, slim-bodied macropod of the open 
          plains is called a "kangaroo"; a small to medium-sized one, particularly if it is relatively thick-set, is a 
          "wallaby": most wallaroos are only a little smaller than a kangaroo, fairly thickset, and are found in open country. 
          All share a particular habit of stance: wrists raised, elbows tucked close into the body, and shoulders thrown back, 
          and all have a large, black-skinned rhinarium.</p>

          <h2><a href="https://a-z-animals.com/animals/fennec-fox/">Fennec Fox</a></h2>
          <p class="description">The fennec fox or fennec (Vulpes zerda) is a small crepuscular fox found in the Sahara of North Africa, 
          the Sinai Peninsula, South West Israel (Arava desert)[2] and the Arabian desert. It's most distinctive feature is its unusually large ears, which also serve to dissipate heat. 
          It's name comes from the Berber word (fanak), which means fox, and the species name zerda comes from the Greek word xeros 
          which means dry, referring to the fox's habitat.[3] The fennec is the smallest species of canid. 
          It's coat, ears, and kidney functions have adapted to high-temperature, low-water, desert environments. 
          Also, its hearing is sensitive enough to hear prey moving underground. 
          It mainly eats insects, small mammals, and birds.</p>

          <h2><a href="https://a-z-animals.com/animals/serval/">Serval</a></h2>
          <p class="description">The serval (Leptailurus serval) is a wild cat native to Africa.
           It is rare in North Africa and the Sahel, but widespread in sub-Saharan countries except rainforest regions.
          It is the sole member of the genus Leptailurus and was first described by German naturalist 
          Johann von Schreber in 1776. Three subspecies are recognised. The serval is a slender, medium-sized cat that 
          stands 54–62 cm (21–24 in) at the shoulder and weighs 9–18 kg (20–40 lb). It is characterised by a small head, large ears, 
          a golden-yellow to buff coat spotted and striped with black, and a short, black-tipped tail. The serval has the 
          longest legs of any cat relative to its body size. </p>

          <h2><a href="https://a-z-animals.com/animals/red-knee-tarantula/">Mexican Redknee Tarantula</a></h2>
          <p class="description">Brachypelma hamorii is a species of tarantula found in Mexico. It has been confused with Brachypelma smithi; 
          both have been called Mexican redknee tarantulas. Many earlier sources referring to B. smithi either do not distinguish between the 
          two species or relate to B. hamorii. B. hamorii is a terrestrial tarantula native to the western faces of the Sierra Madre Occidental 
          and Sierra Madre del Sur mountain ranges in the Mexican states of Colima, Jalisco and Michoacán. The species is a large spider, 
          adult females having a total body length over 50 mm (2 in) and males having legs up to 75 mm (3 in) long. Mexican redknee tarantulas are a 
          popular choice for enthusiasts. Like most tarantulas, it has a long lifespan.</p>

          <h2><a href="https://www2.padi.com/blog/2013/12/16/interesting-facts-about-ribbon-eels/">Bow Eel</a></h2>
          <p class="description">The ribbon eel (Rhinomuraena quaesita), also known as the leaf-nosed moray eel or bernis eel, 
          is a species of moray eel, the only member of the genus Rhinomuraena. What is now known as R. quaesita also includes the former 
          R. amboinensis. R. quaesita was used for blue ribbon eels and R. amboinensis for black ribbon eels, but these are now recognized 
          as the same species. The ribbon eel is found in lagoons and reefs in the Indo-Pacific ocean, 
          ranging from East Africa to southern Japan, Australia and French Polynesia. Although generally placed in the moray eel family Muraenidae, 
          it has several distinctive features leading some to place it in its own family, Rhinomuraenidae.</p>

          <h2><a href="https://a-z-animals.com/animals/red-panda/">Red Panda</a></h2>
          <p class="description">The red panda <font style='font-weight':900>(Ailurus fulgens)</font> is a mammal native to the eastern Himalayas and southwestern China. 
          It is listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List because the wild population is estimated at fewer than 10,000 mature individuals
           and continues to decline due to habitat loss and fragmentation, poaching, and inbreeding depression. The red panda has reddish-brown fur, a long, 
           shaggy tail, and a waddling gait due to its shorter front legs; it is roughly the size of a domestic cat, though with a 
           longer body and somewhat heavier. It is arboreal, feeds mainly on bamboo, but also eats eggs, birds, and insects. 
           It is a solitary animal, mainly active from dusk to dawn, and is largely sedentary during the day.</p>

          <h2><a href="https://a-z-animals.com/animals/poison-dart-frog/">Strawberry Poison Frog</a></h2>
          <p class="description">The strawberry poison frog or strawberry poison-dart frog (Oophaga pumilio, formerly Dendrobates pumilio) 
          is a species of small poison dart frog found in Central America.[2] It is common throughout its range, 
          which extends from eastern central Nicaragua through Costa Rica and northwestern Panama. 
          The species is often found in humid lowlands and premontane forest, but large populations are also found in disturbed areas such as 
          plantations.[3] The strawberry poison frog is perhaps most famous for its widespread variation in coloration, comprising approximately 
          15–30 color morphs, most of which are presumed to be true-breeding. O. pumilio, while not the most poisonous of the dendrobatids, is the most 
          toxic member of its genus.</p>
