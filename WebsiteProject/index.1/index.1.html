            <p>This website is a work in progress and I am making this from scratch. So as I progress
            through my Codecademy Learning path as a Front-End Web Developer, there will be updates and the
            site will be updated accordingly.</p>

                <li class="veterinarian">Large Animal Veterinarian</li>
                    <p>As a practicing Veterinarian, I did everything from birthing pigs, castrating bulls,
                    operating on Anacondas to cleaning a Tiger's teeth.</p>
                <li class="cytogeneticist">Cytgeneticist at Standford University</li>
                    <p>I worked to determine chromosomal abberations by carefully
                    analyzing strands of DNA under a microscope.</p>
                <li class="retail">Propriotor Retail Computer Store</li>
                    <p>Cyberexchange was a franchise that bought and sold used software 
                    when software was still on CD-ROMS.</p>
                <li class="coroner">Coroner's Assistant at the County Morgue</li>
                    <p>I applied for this job out of sheer curiosity and learned surgical techniques
                    that surprisingly were very similar to performing surgeries in animals.</p>
